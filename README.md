# Writing Block

A focus view style writing program with a minimum of frills and features to promote just getting down to business.

That's basically it.

I wrote it in 2016 for NaNoWriMo, but it's been basically untouched since early 2017. I don't plan to revisit this unless my local build breaks. Still, if maybe this will be handy for someone, so no reason not to share it!

No special build instructions, but it (at time of this commit) has not been migrated to Swift4, so that could be a future headache. Builds fine for now, at least.
